## This function caches potentially time consuming function in makeCacheMatrix function and retrieves
## the inverse of the matrix from cache by cacheSolve function if available.
## Otherwise it computes inverse of special matrix in cacheSolve function
## Scoping rule is used to manipulate and preserve the state inside of a R object


## Function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse of matrix
